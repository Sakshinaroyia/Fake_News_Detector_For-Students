# Fake News Detection System Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Fake News Detection System** is a Machine Learning–based project designed to automatically classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake**. With the rapid spread of misinformation on digital platforms, manual fact-checking is no longer scalable. This project demonstrates how **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** can be used to build an efficient and accurate fake news classifier.

This project is suitable for:

* Academic projects & internships
* Machine Learning / Data Science portfolios
* Understanding NLP-based text classification

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Detect fake and real news automatically
* Apply NLP techniques for text preprocessing
* Use TF-IDF for feature extraction
* Train and evaluate a Machine Learning model
* Provide clear performance metrics

---

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**

  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Scikit-learn
  * NLTK
  * Matplotlib / Seaborn
  * WordCloud
* **IDE/Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

* **Dataset Name:** Fake News Detection Dataset
* **Source:** Kaggle
* **Total Samples:** 40,587 news articles
* **Features:**

  * `title` – Headline of the news
  * `text` – Full news content
  * `label` – 1 (Real), 0 (Fake)
